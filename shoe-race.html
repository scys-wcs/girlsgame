                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In Shoe Race, your goal is to quickly select the right shoes for each changing environment. Use your mouse or touchscreen to click and swap shoes as you run. Different shoes work best in different situations - high heels for catwalks, sports shoes for running tracks, hiking boots for rough terrain, and beach shoes for sand.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Timing is everything! Pay close attention to the upcoming terrain and switch shoes before your character reaches it. The faster you adapt, the better you'll perform. Race against opponents and aim to reach the finish line first by making smart shoe choices throughout the course.</p>
